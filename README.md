# boundary
This project helps you define and enforce your boundaries. Healthy boundaries are important for a happy life!

## Why
1. I want to learn how to set better boundaries, and needed a place to write those down (and spreadsheet would do)
2. I wanted to explore supabase + next.js and was looking for a good project

## To Do
- [ ] Create supabase project
- [ ] Create next.js project
- [ ] Table with boundary, crosser, enforce
- [ ] Use RLS to allow only own user to see own boundaries
- [ ] Allow to share boundaries to others. USE RLS for read only support
- [ ] See if login with username + password only is possible. 
- [ ] Show it to the HN community: `Show HN: `
- [x] get a domain and try it with supabase pay as you go: https://boundary.quest
- [ ] Decide on a license (boundary) for this project. It should be OSS but not necessarily allow commercial use
- [ ] Ask on landing page (or somewhere else) for donation
